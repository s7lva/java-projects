# Linked Lists in Java

This project is part of my study of Algorithms and Data Structures. Here I implemented and tested simple linked lists, with operations such as insertion, removal and search.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- Dynamic data structure
- Notions of temporal complexity O(n) and O(1)
- Using classes and methods in Java
- Manipulating nodes with references

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

-Java 17
- intellij idle

Summary of what I'm currently seeing and what I use to program for now
